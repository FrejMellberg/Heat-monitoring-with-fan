# Heat-monitoring-with-fan
An arduino project for simple temperature monitoring and control.  

<p>

</p>
In this project I connect a fan to a temperature sensor and program it to start/stop at different temperatures.
To add some visual monitoring I also connect a LCD screen that gives the temperature, in celsius.
In addition three LEDs, green/yellow/red, is added to indicate how close the temperature is to the chosen limit.

## Equipment used

* Playknowlogy-board (equivalent to Arduino UNO R3 board)
* Breadboard
* 9-v battery
* DC motor (the fan)
* TMP36 sensor
* Transistor irf520 (don´t put next to temp-sensor; gets hot)
* Leds
* Diode
* 4x 220Ω resistors
